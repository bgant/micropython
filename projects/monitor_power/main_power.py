# Usage:
#    ampy -p /dev/ttyUSB0 put main_power.py /main.py
#
# Power Outage Dectection:
# The ESP32 gets power from a wall outlet via USB and a battery. A pair
# of 10Kohm resistors is connected from VUSB (5V) to GND. Between the resistors
# a 2.5V wire is connected to an input pin. If house power is lost, VUSB goes to 0.
# A timestamp and power status change are sent to the MQTT server and logged locally.
# For MQTT to work, your WiFi and network must be on a UPS during the power outage.
